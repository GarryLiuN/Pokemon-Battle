# Pokémon Battle


Pokémon Battle is a simple Pokémon-themed 2-player game built with XNA Game Studio 4.0.<br>
It has features such as movement sprite animation, sound effect...<br>
It was my very first project when I was in high school, that the code is very amateur.<br>
You can input from either keyboard or XBox controller
